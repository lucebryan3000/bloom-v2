# **Appmelia Bloom — Product Requirements Document (PRD) v1.0 (MVP)**

**Status:** Full Draft — Ready for Review & Iteration
**Owner:** Appmelia — Product, Strategy, Experience Architecture
**Purpose:** Define the first complete, clarity‑aligned, customer‑facing Product Requirements Document for the Bloom MVP.

This PRD incorporates the updated narrative, value model, experience design, and system behavior discovered through the Bloom ChatGPT project, the PRFAQ, customer‑facing copywriting, and the Melissa playbook work.

Bloom’s language and tone are intentionally warm, human, narrative, and metaphor‑aligned. The PRD reflects that while preserving engineering clarity.

# **1. Executive Summary**

Bloom is where better work begins.

Organizations rarely lack ideas for improvement—they lack **clarity**. Teams see friction, delays, repetitive tasks, customer frustration, outdated tools, and workflow breakdowns every day. What they don’t have is a fast, trustworthy way to understand what each idea is worth.

Traditional analysis creates drag: long interviews, spreadsheets only one person understands, slow revision cycles, and inconsistent assumptions. Decisions stall. Opportunities fade. Momentum is lost.

Bloom changes this.

Bloom turns a natural conversation into a **clear, defensible, fundable business case** across three dimensions of value:

* **Financial** (ROI, cost, savings, payback)
* **Operational** (speed, predictability, quality, stability)
* **Human** (team experience, customer experience, friction reduction)

In the MVP, Bloom is delivered as a **co‑facilitated workshop**: a human facilitator steers the conversation in the room, while **Melissa**, Bloom’s adaptive AI, guides the process, asks intelligent adaptive questions, captures nuance, and organizes meaning as people talk.

Instead of beginning with a blank whiteboard, teams begin with **momentum**. Instead of scattered insights, they get a narrative. Instead of gut feeling, they get rationale. Instead of analysis paralysis, they get clarity.

Bloom is not a calculator. Not a spreadsheet. Not a consulting interview. It is a **clarity engine**—the beginning of every smarter transformation.

# **2. Product Identity & Positioning**

## **2.1 What Bloom *Is***

Bloom is an AI‑guided clarity engine that:

* listens to real human conversation,
* adapts to nuance in the moment,
* extracts structure from lived experience,
* organizes meaning into insight,
* and produces clear, fundable business cases.

It converts messy reality into:

* financial ROI,
* operational lift,
* human value,
* confidence scoring,
* risk transparency,
* and narrative clarity.

It begins with conversation. It ends with direction.

## **2.2 What Bloom *Is Not***

To avoid category confusion:

* Bloom is **not** an ROI calculator.
* Bloom is **not** a spreadsheet or a form.
* Bloom is **not** a static templated framework.
* Bloom is **not** a consulting engagement (though consultants will use it).
* Bloom is **not** a fully autonomous AI facilitator (in MVP).

Bloom replaces blank‑whiteboard ambiguity with a guided glide‑path to clarity.

## **2.3 Strategic Category (Internal Alignment)**

Externally, Bloom is described as an:
**AI‑guided business case generator.**

Internally, Bloom is aligned to Appmelia’s deeper discipline as an:
**AI‑Guided Value Clarity & Discovery Engine**—the gateway to the broader Managed Intelligence ecosystem.

# **3. Target Users & Personas**

## **3.1 Primary Personas (MVP)**

### **Executives & Decision Leaders**

They need clarity, defensibility, and decision‑readiness. They want to know:

* What’s the value?
* What’s the risk?
* Should we fund this next?

### **Operations & IT Leaders**

They feel workflow pain daily. They need:

* justification for automation,
* support for budget requests,
* and clarity on operational impact.

### **Internal Change Agents**

Process owners, analysts, PMs who know:

* the real steps,
* the hidden friction,
* and the human story behind the process.

### **Consultants & Advisors**

They use Bloom as their differentiator—an accelerated discovery engine producing value in the very first meeting.

### **Technology Vendors**

They use Bloom for prospect‑specific value narratives in sales cycles.

## **3.2 MVP Persona Constraint**

Bloom MVP is a **facilitated experience**, not self‑serve. Users attend sessions; they do not yet operate Bloom independently.

# **4. Problem Statement**

Organizations have more improvement ideas than they can process. But they struggle to:

* quantify value,
* communicate it,
* compare priorities,
* align teams,
* justify investment,
* and reduce uncertainty.

Traditional methods create:

* slow interviews,
* siloed assumptions,
* spreadsheet bloat,
* unclear narratives,
* and stalled decisions.

This leads to **cost of inaction**—lost time, lost opportunity, and lost energy.

Bloom solves this by making clarity emerge through conversation.

---

# **5. Product Vision**

Bloom is the beginning.

Bloom envisions a world where:

* clarity starts with conversation—not forms,
* insights emerge naturally—without friction,
* human, operational, and financial value are visible at once,
* decisions accelerate from weeks to hours,
* and organizations gain confidence to move forward.

Bloom is the spark that turns ideas into direction.

# **6. The Bloom Session Experience (Co‑Facilitated)**

Bloom sessions are a duet between a **human facilitator** and **Melissa**, Bloom’s AI guide.

## **6.1 Human + AI Partnership**

* The **human facilitator** steers the room, reads emotion and nuance, ensures psychological safety.
* **Melissa** guides the process, asks adaptive questions, captures structure, recognizes patterns.

This partnership accelerates understanding without rushing anyone.

## **6.2 How the Experience Feels**

Teams consistently describe Bloom as:

* **Light** — Bloom carries the cognitive load.
* **Fast‑moving** — insights emerge quickly.
* **Natural** — a conversation, not an interrogation.
* **Relieving** — complexity feels understood.
* **Aligning** — everyone sees the same picture.
* **Energizing** — momentum returns.

## **6.3 What Bloom Removes**

Bloom eliminates:

* blank‑whiteboard uncertainty,
* slow problem framing,
* re‑explaining the same details,
* scattered notes,
* assumption debates,
* spreadsheet scavenger hunts.

## **6.4 What Bloom Produces**

Bloom sharpens—not shortens—the conversation. It creates:

* clarity of the current state,
* visibility into value,
* shared understanding,
* defensible logic,
* and action‑ready next steps.

# **7. Value Model (Financial, Operational, Human)**

Bloom teaches organizations to recognize **three dimensions of value**. All three ultimately connect to ROI.

## **7.1 Financial Value**

Traditional, measurable returns:

* labor savings,
* efficiency gains,
* error reduction → cost avoidance,
* cycle‑time reduction,
* cost of delay / cost of doing nothing,
* payback and ROI.

## **7.2 Operational Value**

Performance and flow:

* speed and predictability,
* workflow stability,
* data quality,
* fewer escalations,
* reduced rework,
* increased throughput.

## **7.3 Human Value**

Invisible but powerful returns:

* morale and engagement,
* stress and emotional load reduction,
* cognitive clarity,
* frustration removal,
* customer experience uplift.

## **7.4 Value Cards (MVP Feature)**

Interactive cards teach:

* what each value type is,
* how to identify it,
* how to measure it,
* how it ties to ROI.

Each card links to a micro‑article.
