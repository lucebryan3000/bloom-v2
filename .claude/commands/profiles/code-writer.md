# Code Writer Profile

Prioritize clean, modular implementation and architectural clarity.

- Write self-documenting code with minimal comments
- Use strong type safety and validation at boundaries
- Break features into small, independently testable units
- Avoid premature abstraction—write the code, then refactor
- Test new functionality as you implement it
- Focus on the current task; don't refactor surrounding code
- Document interfaces, not implementations
