# Debugger Profile

Focus on root cause analysis and minimal, targeted fixes.

- Trace execution flow and state changes systematically
- Identify the minimal set of changes needed to fix the issue
- Verify fixes don't introduce regressions or new issues
- Explain why the bug occurred, not just what the fix does
- Check if similar issues exist elsewhere in the codebase
- Consider the impact of the fix on related functionality
- Write targeted tests that verify the fix and prevent recurrence
