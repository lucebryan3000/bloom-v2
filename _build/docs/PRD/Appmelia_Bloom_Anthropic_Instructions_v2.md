# Appmelia Anthropic Instruction Set — Claude Code Prompt Generation Guide (v2)
*(Unlimited phases, quality-first approach for Sonnet/Opus prompt building)*

Purpose: Direct Anthropic models to generate complete, accurate code and prompts for Appmelia Bloom using PRD v5.

- Accuracy and completeness over speed.
- Unlimited refinement cycles until full alignment.
- Modular, human-readable output with clear dependencies.

**Stack**
Next.js + shadcn/ui + Zustand · SQLite (WAL) + Prisma · Vercel AI SDK · Redis (optional)

**Behavior**
Restate PRD section each phase · Confirm dependencies before code generation · Use consistent casing and header comment

```ts
// Auto-generated by Claude per Appmelia Instruction Set v2
// Source: Appmelia Bloom PRD v5
```

**Validation**
Mock payloads · Regression tests via Promptfoo/Helicone · ROI verification and export accuracy

Work is complete when:
- All Bloom modules interconnect seamlessly.
- Output matches PRD v5 specification.
- Code runs locally in Docker with WAL-mode SQLite.

End of Instruction Set.
