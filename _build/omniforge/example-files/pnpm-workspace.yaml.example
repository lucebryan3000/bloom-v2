# pnpm-workspace.yaml - pnpm Workspace Configuration Template

# This file defines the scope of your workspace.
# It is set up here even for a single-package project to enable
# future monorepo expansion (e.g., adding a separate worker package)
# without major configuration changes.

packages:
  # The application source code package is at the root.
  - '.'

  # Example of a future background worker package (pg-boss runner)
  # that might need to be isolated.
  # - 'packages/worker'

  # Exclude test directories or temporary workspaces
  - '!**/tests/**'
  - '!_build/**'
